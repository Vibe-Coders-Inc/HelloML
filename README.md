What it does:

Answers FAQs using your hours, menu/services, and policies.
Books/holds reservations or appointments when available.
Escalates or forwards calls to staff when needed.
Logs calls and transcripts with redaction for sensitive info.

How it works (at a glance)
Caller dials your number.
HelloML transcribes speech, understands intent, and replies with a natural voice.
It pulls facts from your knowledge (hours, FAQ, menu, rules) and confirms actions (e.g., a table at 6:30pm).
Conversation history keeps context within the call; important calls can be transferred to humans.

Who it’s for:
Restaurants, salons, clinics, home services, and any local business that can’t afford to miss calls or keep customers on hold.

Why it’s different:
Natural, brand-aligned conversations—no rigid phone trees.
Fast answers grounded in your real business data.
Built-in redaction, rate-limits, and audit-friendly logs.

Common use cases:
“What are your hours today?”
“Can I book a table for six at 6:30?”
“Do you offer gluten-free options?”
“I need to talk to the manager about catering.”
